title: "Master's internship offer: Influence of interannual variability in ocean circulation on the 3D distribution of microplastics"
---
We are offering a funded master's 2 internship (6 months) at [LOPS](https://www.umr-lops.fr/) in Brest to work on **interannual variability** of ocean circulation and its influence on **microplastic distribution** in the ocean. 

We are looking for a master's student, willing to work on **numerical modeling** of microplastic distribution in the global ocean, using a [dedicated global model](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.947309/full). 

This internship is opened for **masters students from [SEA-EU](https://sea-eu.org/) Universities**. Funding is granted by French law (~600â‚¬/month) and the work will be carried on site in Brest.
